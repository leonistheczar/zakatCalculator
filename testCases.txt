Algorithm for Zakat Calculator Project
The following algorithm outlines the steps for calculating Zakat based on a user's assets, liabilities, and applicable Islamic rules.

🔹 Step 1: Input Collection
Prompt user to enter assets:

Cash & Bank Savings
Gold & Silver (grams or value)
Stocks & Investments
Land for Sale
Agricultural Produce & Livestock
Cryptocurrency & Digital Assets
Rental Income Savings
Prompt user to enter liabilities:

Short-term debts (loans due within a year)
Other allowable deductions (if applicable per their madhab)
🔹 Step 2: Nisab Calculation
Determine Nisab threshold:

Ask user if they want to use Gold (85g) or Silver (595g) as the reference.
Convert to currency using real-time or predefined values.
Compare total Zakatable assets with Nisab:

If Total Assets < Nisab, no Zakat is due → End Program.
If Total Assets ≥ Nisab, proceed to Zakat calculation.

🔹 Step 3: Zakat Calculation
Apply Zakat formula (2.5%) on Zakatable assets:

Zakat Due = 2.5 % × (Total Zakatable Assets−Deductible Liabilities)
Zakat Due=2.5%×(Total Zakatable Assets−Deductible Liabilities)
Special Cases:

Gold Jewelry: Check if Zakat applies (depends on madhab).
Stocks: Ask if for resale (full value) or investment (only dividends or zakatable portion).
Land: If for resale, apply 2.5% on current market value.
Agriculture: Apply 5% or 10% based on irrigation method.
Livestock: Check Zakat eligibility based on herd size.

🔹 Step 4: Display Results
Show Total Zakat Due along with a breakdown.
Provide guidance on payment methods (to poor, eligible recipients).
🔹 Step 5: Additional Features (Optional)

Save calculation history for future reference.
Allow real-time Nisab updates using API (gold/silver prices).
Support multiple madhab opinions and let users choose preferences.
